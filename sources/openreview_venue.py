"""One-shot fetch of a conference's full accepted-paper set from OpenReview.

Unlike `sources.openreview.OpenReviewSource` (which pulls a rolling window
of recently-created submissions for the daily/weekly incremental pipeline),
this fetches *every* submission for a venue, keeps only the ones whose
decision routed them to the venue itself, and returns them as `Paper`
objects. Meant for one-off conference batch analysis (e.g.
`scripts/venue_report.sh`), not the daily cron.

Decision detection follows the common OpenReview v2 convention: once
decisions are released, an accepted submission's `content.venueid.value` is
rewritten from the `/-/Submission` invitation venue to the venue string
itself (e.g. "MLSys.org/2026/Conference"); rejected/withdrawn submissions
get a `.../Rejected_Submission` or `.../Withdrawn_Submission` suffix
instead. On a venue you haven't run before, inspect a sample of
`content.venueid.value` values in the raw page cache and adjust
`_is_accepted` if the actual field differs (see the "new-venue caveat" in
`skills/venue-trend/SKILL.md`).

    Paginates `/-/Submission` notes to completion (no time window), keeps

    them as `Paper` objects. Raises `VenueFetchIncomplete` if any page fails
    after retries. If `page_cache_dir` is given, each raw page is persisted
    there and reused on a subsequent call, so a re-run after a mid-run
    failure resumes instead of restarting from offset 0.

    Caution: the cache never expires. It's meant to survive a same-day
    retry after a 403/timeout, not to be reused across runs taken before
    and after decisions are released — a later run pointed at the same
    `page_cache_dir` will serve stale pre-decision pages and miss papers
    whose `venueid` only just flipped to accepted. Delete `page_cache_dir`
    before re-running against a venue whose decisions may have changed.
